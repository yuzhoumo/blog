So I purchased flights from San Francisco to Newark with 26 hours of layovers
and a travel time of... 32 HOURS?!

With no lodging and no plans, I arrived in Las Vegas at midnight for a literal
one day layover. A full 24 hours of crashing at airport gates and random hotel
lobbies. Wandering alone across the the entire Vegas Strip through dozens of
shops, hotels, and casinos. The amount I spent on gambling and entertainment?
$0. Of course, that number would be higher had I been in the company of
others. The point of this trip was to have fun, after all, and I'll be doing
plenty of spending when I reach my actual destination.

Why did I choose this flight? Partially because it was the cheapest option (at
the time), partially because I found the thought amusing, partially on a gut
feeling. It's that gut feeling that I'm most interested in understanding.

I think that feeling stems from an urge to test myself, or perhaps a
curiousity of how I'd handle things. Obviously, I wouldn't take this to the
point of reckless self-sabotage, but voluntarily taking on some occasional
inconveniences builds patience and valuable experience for when events do go
sour. Think: this is a piece of cake; I've been through this before, and I can
get through it again! I'd been reading Marcus Aurelius's _Meditations_, which
no doubt inspired my decision.

I've also realized that on longer trips, I often enjoy the journey as much as
the destination -- that weird in-between stage of travel where the lines
between today and yesterday become blurred, and the entire segment feels like
one continuous splotch of memory. I'm quite the introvert, and it's times like
these where I conduct the deepest introspection. There's no pressure to do
anything other than getting from point A to point B, just free time to think.

It's a good opportunity to write blog posts like this one, to reflect on life,
to plan and get motivated to start new personal projects upon arriving home.
Not only am I physically and mentally miles away from home but also miles away
from my destination. It's in this liminal space that thoughts can flow
unhindered by day-to-day or travel-related tasks.

So was it worth it? I'm pretty tired, but I did some valuable self discovery
on the way. Or maybe I'm just stupid. Now time for my actual destination... ðŸ˜‚
