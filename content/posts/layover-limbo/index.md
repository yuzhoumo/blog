I purchased flights from San Francisco to Newark with 26 hours of layovers and
a total travel time of... 32 hours?!

With no lodging and no plans, I arrived in Las Vegas at midnight for my
day-long layover. A full 24 hours of crashing at airport gates and random
hotel lobbies; roaming alone across the entire Vegas Strip through dozens of
shops, hotels, and casinos. The amount I spent on gambling and entertainment?
$0 (with the exception of a wrap from CVS, a Chipotle bowl, and some water).
Of course, that number would be higher had I been in the company of others.
The point of this trip was to have fun, after all, and I'll be doing plenty of
spending when I reach my actual destination.

I've realized that on longer trips, I often enjoy the journey as much as the
destination -- that weird in-between stage of travel blurring the lines
between today and yesterday, making the entire segment feels like one
continuous splotch of memory. It's during times like these where I find myself
in the deepest introspection. There's no pressure to do anything other than
getting from point A to point B. There's just free time to think.

It's usually a good chance to write blog posts like this one, to reflect on
life, to plan and get motivated on starting new personal projects upon
arriving home. Not only am I physically and mentally miles away from home
but also miles away from my destination. It's in this liminal space that
thoughts can flow unhindered by day-to-day tasks or travel itineraries.

Was that why I choose this flight? Well, partially. It was also because it
was the cheapest option at the time, and it was also out of amusement. I have
a very ironic sense of humor, and stranding myself in sin city to reflect on
life was just too funny. Imagine journaling in a cigarette-smoke filled
casino or doing some soul-searching in front of a strip club! How could I pass
that opportunity up?

Jokes aside, there was an urge to test myself: a curiousity of how I'd handle
my usual routines juxtaposed against ridiculous circumstances. Obviously, I
wouldn't take this to the point of reckless self-sabotage, but voluntarily
taking on some occasional inconveniences builds patience and valuable
experience for when events do go sour. Think: this is a piece of cake; I've
been through this before, and I can get through it again! I'd been reading
Marcus Aurelius's _Meditations_, which no doubt inspired my decision.

So was it worth it? I'm pretty tired, but I did some valuable self discovery
on the way. Or maybe I'm just stupid. Now time for my actual destination! ðŸ˜‚
