I am 30,000 feet in the air and painfully aware of the fact that I am
disconnected from the internet; But even up here, I have the option to pay
$15 for a measly 1 hour of that sweet, sweet drip of network packets. Maybe one
day that too will be taken for granted, just as mobile data went from luxury
to necessity. In the meantime, that $15 paywall is enough to keep my cheap ass
from biting ðŸ¤£.

When I'm not sleeping through the entire flight, I really do enjoy the rare
hours of forced focus. In fact, I've come to realize that it's almost the only
time I don't have access to the internet.

What do I use that focus for? Writing, reading... sometimes programming.
Though as I open my editor, it always dawns on me how much I rely on the web.
Perhaps I'm just serially online, but somehow I feel that I'm not in the
minority nowadays, especially as a programmer.

What is the modern-day programmer without a search engine? Without Stack
Overflow? And recently, without an LLM?

I'm no luddite that romanticizes the days of punch cards and switchboards with
physical pluggable wires. We can abstract machine code with assembly and
assembly with compilers; we can run our programs through linters, debuggers,
and language servers; we can search web forums for shared solutions from
fellow developers. These are all great innovations that have carried us to
accomplishments that would otherwise be orders of magnitude more difficult.

However, we must not forget that each abstraction we build is also a tradeoff
in individual ability. Open an empty file in your favorite text editor. No
Stackoverflow; no autocomplete; no external dependencies; no prompting LLMs.
Now what? When was the last time you cracked open a man page? How well do you
really know your favorite language's standard library? I used to be pretty good
at that, but I've noticed I struggled with it more after college.

In the age of desk jobs and automobiles, we go to purpose-built exercise
facilities to get the physical activity that we once took for granted. That
doesn't mean we should get rid of all modern transportation, but it does
highlight something obvious. Just as our muscles atrophy without use, so does
our mind without thought; and most of us could really use a workout.

Just a few weeks ago, I witnessed a coworker ask GitHub Copilot:

"How do I get this url using curl? theurl.com/content"

To which it responded:

"curl -X GET theurl.com/content".

Is this really our fate? To become copy-paste developers reliant on proprietary
pay-per-request SaaS to think for us?

However, as much as I dislike the LLM-wrapper-fueled hype cycle, I'd be
hard-pressed to wholly deny its usefulness in certain domains. We just need to
be cautious of the fact that every line of code suggested to us by mechanized
means is a thought outsourced to a machine.

Done well, we free precious mental resources to be reallocated elsewhere.
Done poorly, we stop thinking at all. I'm all for boosting productivity with
these tools, but let's make sure that productivity doesn't drop to zero without
them.

The act of machine-assisted programming no longer affords enough mental
challenge, so we need intentional practice, sans crutches, lest we lose those
skills altogether or, for those new to the field, never develop them in the
first place.
