Cramming the day before exams, zombie-ing through lectures, or sludging through
a textbook and realizing you don't remember a thing — these are probably
experiences that most college students relate with. As a second semester senior
with my graduation date fast approaching, I want to reflect on what's worked
for me over the years and also take my last chance to refine my methods before
graduation. After all, mastering _how to learn_ carries over to all areas of
life, unlike mastering _how to cram-for-a-test-last-minute_. These are the
things I've picked up over the years that have actually worked for me, along
with some new things I'm trying this semester.

## Overcoming Procrastination

Take a deep breathe; rip yourself out of bed; stop your YouTube marathon; quit
playing that video game; stop scrolling through Instagram. JUST DO IT. This is
probably the most obvious but hardest step to overcome, thus the one I will
write the most about. Of course nothing is going to get done if you don't start,
no matter how good your methods are. Everything else you implement makes it
easier to start being productive and continue being productive, but nothing can
happen until you actually start.

### Discipline > Motivation

**Discipline** is greater than **motivation**. You will not always feel
motivated, so don't wait to feel motivated. You know what needs to be done, so
do it regardless if you like it or not. You'll have to face whatever it is
eventually, and now is better than later. Drill this into your head. Remind
yourself. Hell, write it on your hand and put post-it notes on your monitor.
The best time to start was yesterday, the second best time to start is NOW.

The best way to build discipline is to build a history of completing hard tasks.
Start with small things like making your bed every day after waking up or
cleaning the house every week. Then step up the difficulty from there. Soon
you can think back to all the things you accomplished, doing them anyway despite
being hard. Then you can think to yourself, "If I've done all that, what makes
this current task so bad?" and you'll just do the next task that comes your way.

### Maintaining willpower

Think of willpower as a gas tank. Refill it by sleeping, exercising, and eating
(healthy!!) food. You have a limited supply of willpower each day, so use it
wisely. Make the things you need to accomplish easier to start, and make the
distraction harder to start. Here's what I did:

- Delete Instagram/Twitter/Facebook/Reddit/YouTube/TikTok etc from your phone.
  You don't need them. If you absolutely must, just use them in your web browser.

- Move your phone to the other side of the room at night. When your morning
  alarm goes off and you go to turn it off... look, you're already up!

- Always keep the things you need to be productive on hand. Need to access a
  course website for homework? Bookmark it. Want to read a book? Put it next to
  your bed or carry it with you. Make it easier for yourself to start.

- Don't look at your phone for the first 30 minutes of your day. Scrolling
  through apps as soon as you wake up drains your energy and wastes your time.

### Sticking to a calendar

- Make a schedule that you actually want to live. Schedule in time to be
  productive, but also make room for breaks. Of course you won't stick to
  schedules that you hate. Why would you? You're human and you _will_ get tired
  of a punishing schedule. Be realistic; you're not going to study 10 hours
  straight every day of the week.

- Plan less, do more. Don't plan to read 10 pages, just plan to read 1 page.
  Don't plan to finish an assignment, just plan to start it. This reduces the
  chance you'll get overwhelmed by your plans, and you'll find it's much easier
  to continue something than to overcome the inertia to get started. Before you
  know it, you'll be on your 10th page — you just need the ounce of willpower it
  takes to start reading one.

- Forgive yourself. "I missed my target today, so may as well stop trying" is
  a fallacy. If you planned to something at 5pm and now it's 6pm, oh well,
  finish what you can now and do better tomorrow.

- Track what you accomplished each day. I write down all the tasks I finished
  in a notes app. This will help you get a sense of how well you're doing. If you
  had a lot of completed tasks on your list, great! It feels good to look back on
  them. If not, then it's motivation to do better tomorrow.

- Always reward yourself for being productive. This could be watching an
  episode of a TV show or eating out. Don't overdo it though, and make sure you
  actually deserve it when you do.

## Taking Notes

I used to take notes in single-subject notebooks and end up a lot of wasted
blank pages at the end or notes that were out of order. If the professor was
speaking too fast, I'd also miss some information in my notes and run out of
space to fill it in later. It was hard to search my notes for information.

Now I use a binder of loose notebook paper. By writing notes on loose pages in
a binder, I use the same binder for all my subjects, and I can re-order pages
however I want. After lectures (as soon as possible), I transfer my notes to
Obsidian so that they're easily searchable. If there's anything I missed during
lecture, this is when I go back and fill it in.

Doing this may seem redundant, but it's a good opportunity to review the notes
you took in addition to making them more organized and searchable (because
let's be real, how often do most students actually review their notes?). Also,
writing with pen and paper first helps with remembering concepts better than
typing. Plus, I don't get distracted by my laptop during lectures.

I also realized that I have a tendency to copy lecture slides word for word.
A good rule of thumb is to write down only concepts that are either very
important (good professors will tell you) or things that you know you'll forget.

## Focus

### Getting rid of brain fog

I get pretty bad brain fog after sitting down for a whole day, and I've
realized how important good posture and exercise affects your mental power.
Cardio exercise like walking and jogging, good sitting posture, good sleep,
and staying hydrated are essential for ample bloodflow to the brain.

I would always get worse brain fog at home compared to at college and I could
never figure out why. I recently realized it was due to the amount of time
spent sitting. At home, I would be sitting at my desk for much longer than at
college, where I would walk in between classes, my apartment, and dining halls.
I cannot overstate how important that difference makes in my productivity.

### The 30 minute rule

Most people crap out at the 30 minute mark and their focus declines from there.
You should plan around this limitation. The good news is that a 5 minute break
is all you need to refresh your focus. Make sure your breaks are _actual_
breaks. Don't scroll through social media or watch videos. They will also
deplete your ability to focus. Instead, take a walk or stretch. Drink some water.

### Focused learning mode vs review mode

Don't listen to music if the task you are doing needs deep focus. Complete
silence or listening to white noise is better for maintaining deep focus than
listening to music. If your task is tedious or involves _reinforcement_ rather
than _learning_, then music can be a nice addition to keep things interesting.
Avoid anything too distracting or songs that have lyrics.

### Dedicated study space

Separate your environments. Don't work and sleep in the same room. Go to a
library or designate a "work only" desk. I know for fact when I get back to
my room, I'm going to waste time watching YouTube or get distracted by my phone.
That's why I do most of my studying in university libraries. Being surrounded
by other productive people and limiting your own distractions goes a long way
to maintaining your productivity.

## Retention

### Focus on the big picture at first

Focus on the general idea at first instead of trying to remember all the small
details. This will give you a better idea of the whole picture instead of trying
to memorize a bunch of small puzzle pieces and figuring out how they fit.

Learn _what_ something accomplishes first, not _how_ it accomplishes it. Then,
see if you're at a level where you could explain what you learned to a five
year old. Dive into the details after you can comfortably do this.

### Use mneumonics to remember facts

As an example, I just had a compiler class where I needed to remember the
phases of code compilation, and I used the mneumonic "LP SIM CoM".

```
L  exical analysis
P  arsing

S  emantic analysis
I  ntermediate code generation
M  achine-independent optimization

Co de generation
M  achine-dependent optimization
```

Mneumonics don't have to make sense! They just need to relate to concepts you
are already familiar with. I can remember LP because it's a common abbreviation
for "liquidity provider", SIM as in "SIM card", and "CoM" as in ".com".

This specific mneumonic might not be memorable at all to someone else, but
that's the point. Make up mneumonics personalized to YOU, based on YOUR
experiences. This will make them more memorable for yourself.

### Reinforce what you've learned

You will forget what you learned if you never use it. You need to reinforce
your learning by either practicing (if applicable) or reviewing.

Quiz yourself. Use flashcards for facts or practice how to do something from
memory if it's a skill. Try teaching what you've learned to someone else, or
if no one is available, then teach it to a rubber duck. You will figure out
the weak points in your understanding if you can't explain a particular detail
all that well.

### Space things out

Stop cramming right before deadlines. Repitition over time will ingrain what
you've learned, even if it's only for 10 minutes a day, be consistent. Don't
make excuses. If you don't have an hour to spare for reinforcing what you've
learned, you at least have 10 minutes. Any productive time spent reinforcing
what you've learned is time well spent.

## Conclusion

This list is by no means exhaustive, but these are some of the things than
helped me immensely. Another thing to remember is that this is by no means an
overnight process. Learning how to learn is a skill in and of itself! You'll
get better with more practice. These skills take time to develop and they'll
become second nature with enough repetition. Best of luck!
