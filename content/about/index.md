Hey there, I'm Joe! I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from
[UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I'm currently working at
[Aruba Networks](https://www.arubanetworks.com/) as a systems software engineer.

I'm passionate about technology and deeply concerned about its ethical use. In
our digitized world, public understanding of the software we depend on is
crucial for a free and open society. I'm curious about the systems that make
the world tick and always open to hear others' perspectives. Feel free to
conact me via any of the methods below.

This website is primarily a place for me to organize my thoughts and share
what I'm working on. If you'd like, take a look at my blog and maybe you'll
find something interesting!
