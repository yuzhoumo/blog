Hey there, I'm Joe! I'm a 4th year studying Computer Science and Data Science
at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

I'm passionate about technology and deeply concerned about its ethical use.
My long-term goals are to be mindful of the impact I make as a developer, to
never stop learning, and to share my experiences with others. In our digitized
world, public understanding of the software we depend on is crucial for a free
and open society.

This site is primarily a place for me to organize my thoughts and share what
I'm working on. If you'd like, give my blog a glance and maybe you'll find
something interesting!
